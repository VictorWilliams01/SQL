SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.customers;
SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;
SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.FebSales;

SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.MaySales;

# I EXECUTED THE FOLLOWING SQL QUERY TO GET :

#1. How many orders that were placed in january ?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) as num_Jan_orders
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
;

#2. How many of those orders were for an iphone ?
SELECT product, COUNT(orderID) as num_Iphone_orders
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#3. Select the custormer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id = Feb.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price ?
SELECT product, price 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price asc LIMIT 1
;
#OR
SELECT distinct product, price
